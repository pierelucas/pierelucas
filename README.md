## 🚀 About Me

My journey into the intricate landscapes of Cybersecurity began early, around the age of nine, exploring cracking and hacking forums. This evolved through phases of online fraud forums and also lots of game hacking. Today, I'm dedicated to ethical (mostly :P) hacking and cybersecurity, where my understanding of vulnerabilities comes from a hands-on, albeit unconventional, start.

My primary tools of trade include:

* **Languages:** C#, C/C++, Golang, Python, Rust and Type/Javascript.
* **Fields:** Cybersecurity, Reverse Engineering, Penetration Testing, Software Development
